title: SQL Joins

comment: Learn about SQL joins: what they accomplish, and how to write them.

long_description: Usually, data in a SQL database is organized into multiple interrelated tables.  This means you will often have to bring data together from two or more tables into a single dataset to answer your research questions.  This "join" action is accomplished using `JOIN` commands.  This module teaches types of joins, join criteria, and how to write `JOIN` code.

estimated_time_in_minutes: 60

@pre_reqs
Learners should have experience writing SQL code on single tables.  If you have successfully used a "SELECT... FROM... WHERE" SQL statement on a single table, and have at least seen "GROUP BY" commands in action, even if you would need help writing the GROUP BY code, you have enough code ability.  We also highly recommend that you understand the concepts of one-to-many data relationships and database normalization to get the most out of this module. 

If you need to develop basic SQL fluency we recommend our module [SQL Basics](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/sql_basics/sql_basics.md).  For more intermediate topics, we suggest our module [SQL Intermediate](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/sql_intermediate/sql_intermediate.md).  Finally, to learn about one-to-many data relationships and database normalization, consider our [Database Normalization](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/database_normalization/database_normalization.md) module.

# SQL Joins
@sql_series_slide

--{{0}}--
Welcome! 
I'm Meredith Lee, and I use she/her pronouns. 
I'm a data instructor on the Arcus Education team in DBHi, which is a part of CHOP's Data Education Collaborative. 
Today's talk is the final piece of our five-part series on sequel, or S-Q-L.  
Today's webinar will be recorded, so please leave your cameras and mics turned off until the question time at the end.
If you do have questions that come up during the talk, feel free to put them in the chat. 
So with that, let's get started!

## Today's talk

@todays_talk 

--{{0}}--
Today, we'll be learning how to combine data from two or more interrelated tables into one dataset using the JOIN command. This is a hands-on webinar -- we'll be writing some real SQL code! If that sounds daunting, don't worry; I'll provide plenty of scaffolding, and we'll work through things together. 

--{{0}}--
In the last webinar in this series my colleague Elizabeth Drellich taught you how to write intermediate-level SQL queries using CASE, LIKE, and GROUP BY, as well as how to use some aggregate functions.  Today, we'll first quickly review those commands, and then we'll learn how to combine data from multiple tables using the JOIN command. 

## Thank you!

<div class = "gratitude">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Thank you!</b><br>

Material for this talk is based closely on the DART module @module_link, written by Joy Payton.

</div>

--{{0}}--
Many thanks to Joy for her work developing this excellent content!

Our webinar today will **not** cover all of the topics in the module, as we simply won't have time, so I suggest you check it out after our session. 

## Learn by doing

@teams_polls

--{{0}}--
We're firm believers that the best way to learn is to practice! As I mentioned before, we will have opportunities to practice writing our own SQL code today using tables containing fake medical records. There will also be some short quizzes to help solidify your understanding as we go.

--{{0}}--
With that being said, lets get started!

## SQL: A Quick Review

**SQL** (**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage) has, for more than four decades, been used to interact with **relational databases**.

A relational database is a data storage solution that stores data tables, which are comprised of columns (also called 'fields') and rows.

--{{0}}--
First, let's quickly review some key concepts from our previous four sessions. 

"Sequel", or S-Q-L (either pronunciation is fine) stands for **Structured Query Language**. SQL a specialized programming language that is used to interact with Relational Databases. 

--{{0}}--
Relational databases consist of many different data tables. Today we will be working with multiple tables that are stored in a single relational database. 

{{1}}
*****
<h4> What SQL is for: </h4>
isolating and combining just the data you're interested in, such as:

 * extracting columns you're interested in
 * filtering to just the data that meets specific criteria
*****
--{{1}}--
SQL is great at working with rectangular data, data that is stored in tables with rows and columns / fields. 

{{2}}
*****
<h4> What SQL is **NOT** good for: </h4>

* fine tuned statistical, linguistic, or data visualization needs
*****
--{{2}}--
However, it's not great for fine-tuned statistical, linguistic, or data visualization purposes.  SQL is therefore a tool that is often partnered with other tools like R or Python, which are better suited for work like statistical analysis. We will, however, see some of the ways that SQL can generate simple summary statistics today.

### Flavors of SQL

--{{0}}--
SQL is technically not just one thing -- there are a variety of different implementations. Although all SQL implementations have a similar structure, and the same basic syntax, each different SQL database product often has its own minor variations in dialect.

--{{0}}--
Colloquially people often refer to the different SQL dialects as different "flavors" of SQL.

Some popular "flavors" of SQL:

* [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/) (open source)
* [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org) (open source)
* [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) (open source)
* [**Oracle**](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sql.html) (proprietary)
* [**BigQuery**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) (proprietary)


--{{0}}--
The most common difference between different SQL "flavors" are the availability of different functions that users can use for data manipulation, as well as the types of error messages that will be returned to the user when running code with syntax issues. There may be a few times during this webinar when I will point out that the flavor of SQL we are using today is impacting the outputs we get. 

--{{0}}--
Because different flavors can have different outputs, knowing the specific flavor or dialect of SQL your database uses is especially useful when first getting started writing queries and troubleshooting errors. Whenever you search for documentation online or are troubleshooting, you'll want to be sure to include the name of the "flavor" you're working with in your search terms. 

{{1}}
*****
<h3>Flavor of the Day: [**AlaSQL**](https://alasql.org/) </h3> 
*****

--{{1}}-- 
In the hands-on portion of this webinar, we'll be using a form of SQL that actually runs in your web browser as you look at these pages.  This lightweight SQL engine is called "AlaSQL".  We pre-populated some tables for you to experiment with in this presentation.  These tables are filled with fabricated data meant to look a little like an electronic health record (EHR).  Rest assured that this data was completely invented, although it might look realistic!

### SELECT, FROM, WHERE

`SELECT`, as its name suggests, is used to select the particular columns you want, and `FROM` is used to specify the table or tables those columns are from. 

--{{0}}--
Before we learn any new SQL commands, let's do a quick review of the commands SELECT, FROM, and WHERE that we learned about last month.

--{{0}}--
To select only the columns (or fields) you want, you can use a `SELECT` statement. `SELECT` specifies the columns you're interested in, and `FROM` specifies the table (or tables) those columns are from.

{{0}}
*****
```sql
SELECT 
  patients.id
  ,patients.address
  ,patients.city
  ,patients.county
  ,patients.state
FROM alasql.patients
```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable_select_list_fields")

<details open>

<summary>**Results of Query (click to collapse or expand this section)**</summary>

<table id="dataTable_select_list_fields" border="1"></table>

</details><br/><br/>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_patients

</div>

*****

--{{0}}--
Here, we have selected "id", "address", "city", "county", and "state", which is a subset of the columns it the patient table.

--{{0}}--
As a reminder, we recommend using dot notation and comma-first style to list the specific fields you want to see.

{{1}}
*****
Use `WHERE` to return only rows for which a conditional statement is true:

```sql
SELECT 
  patients.id
  ,patients.address
  ,patients.city
  ,patients.county
  ,patients.state
FROM alasql.patients
WHERE
	patients.county = "Suffolk County";
```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable_where")

<details open>

<summary>**Results of Query (click to collapse or expand this section)**</summary>

<table id="dataTable_where" border="1"></table>

</details><br/><br/>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_patients

</div>

*****

--{{1}}--

The **WHERE clause**, using the `WHERE` keyword, is the section of your query used to specify any "filtering logic" that should be applied to your query before returning any output.  It's optional but very useful.

--{{1}}-- 
As an example, here's how you'd filter the output to only include records for a specific county.


### DISTINCT and ORDER BY

--{{0}}--
Now let's quickly review the DISTINCT and ORDER BY keywords.

Use `DISTINCT` to limit a result set to only unique row values; this is placed directly after the `SELECT` keyword.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT allergies.description
FROM alasql.allergies;
```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable_allergies")

<details open>

<summary>**Results of Query (click to collapse or expand this section)**</summary>

<table id="dataTable_allergies" border="1"></table><br>

</details><br/><br/>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_allergies

</div>
--{{0}}--
The `DISTINCT` keyword can be placed directly after the `SELECT` keyword to limit your result set to only the unique row values. 

{{1}}
*****
Use `ORDER BY` to order the result set by one or more columns. 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  patients.county
  ,patients.ethnicity
FROM alasql.patients
ORDER BY
  patients.county ASC
  ,patients.ethnicity DESC;
```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable14a")

<details open>

<summary>**Results of Query (click to collapse or expand this section)**</summary>

<table id="dataTable14a" border="1"></table>

</details><br/><br/>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_patients

</div>

*****

--{{1}}--
The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to order your results by a given set of one or more columns, in either ascending or descending order (the default being ascending). If you list more than one column, items will be sorted first by the first column you provide, and then, within "ties", by the second, then third, etc.  


--{{1}}--
For instance, this code sorts first by `county`, and then within each possible value of `county` sorts by `ethnicity`. Let's run it and take a look at the output. 

### CASE, LIKE, GROUP BY, and HAVING

--{{0}}--
A `CASE` statement produces conditional output based on some input (similar to an "if" statement in other languages) with multiple possibilities, or "cases," that are considered.

## Overview of Joins

Most SQL queries require something more complex than referencing data from a single table. Using the `JOIN` command, data from two SQL tables can be joined together. 

This is what a SQL join looks like: 

```sql
SELECT
  disease.subject_id
  ,disease.lung_cancer
  ,smoking.smoking_pack_years
FROM disease JOIN smoking
ON disease.subject_id = smoking.subject_id;
```

--{{0}}--
Up to now, we have be working with data from one table at a time. However, often the questions you want to answer will require referencing more than one table-- this is where SQL "join" functionality and the `JOIN` keyword come into play. 

### Joins: Why?

--{{0}}--
Let's consider the case where you have data about a multi-site study's research subjects. One table holds depression scores for subjects and a different table holds subject addresses.  Your hypothesis is that people who live in certain zip codes have higher rates of depression.  

--{{0}}--
To see if your hypothesis has evidence to back it, you need to combine data, taking the subject ID and depression score from one table, and the subject ID and zip code from another table, and combining them, so that you get matching information in the same table row.

Maybe your source tables look something like the tables below:

**Table 1: depression\_scale**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style="font-size:80%"-->
| subj\_id  | date  | dep\_q1  | dep\_q2   | dep\_q3  | dep\_q4  | dep\_total   |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 11234   | 2021-05-15   | 3    | 3  | 2    | 4    | 12    |
| 86234   | 2021-06-01   | 4    | 4  | 3    | 4    | 15    |
| 32660   | 2021-06-10   | 1    | 1  | 2    | 1    | 5   |
| 86234   | 2022-01-13   | 2    | 2  | 1    | 3    | 8    |
| 41356   | 2022-02-10   | 1    | 3  | 2    | 3    | 10   |

**Table 2: subject\_address**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style="font-size:80%"-->
| subj\_id  | street\_address  | city  | state   | zip  | date\_start  | date\_end   |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 11234   | 123 Main Street   | Smithtown    | PA  | 19000    | 2022-01-01   | `NULL`    |
| 11234   | 123 Oak Lane   | Old Towne    | PA  | 18000   | 2000-01-01    | 2021-12-31    |
| 93452   | 123 Green Blvd  | Kirby    | TN  | 37000    | 2020-05-01    | `NULL`   |


What you want to eventually end up with will be a single table of results that might only have three columns: "subj\_id", "dep\_total", and "zip".  That way you can look at the relationship between depression inventory scale and zip code.

### Joins: How? 

There are two basic pieces of information you need to know to write successful joins:

{{1}}
*****
**Type of join**: What type of join do you want to use? The type of join shows up in SQL in a `FROM` statement, and will look something like:

`FROM [table_1] [optional keyword] JOIN [table_2]`
*****

--{{1}}--
Let's say you have some students with math grades and some students with language grades.  Some students are in only the math table, some are only in the language table, and some are in both.  What part of the overlapping data do you want?  Only the data on students with both kinds of grades?  Or some other, larger set of student data? The answer to this question will determine what type of join you choose. 

{{2}}
*****
**Join criteria**: What criteria would you like your join evaluated against?  In other words, how are you matching rows from one table to rows from another table?

The join criteria shows up in SQL in an `ON` or `USING` statement, and will look something like:

`ON [table_1.field_name] = [table_2.field_name]` 

OR

`USING(field_name)` (this method is less frequently used)

*****

--{{2}}--
When thinking about join criteria, we want to know what constitutes a "match" of data from one table to data from another. If you're joining tables that hold student grades, for example, you probably want to only join data together where the student ID matches.

--{{2}}--
It can be surprisingly tricky to figure out what makes data "match" or "go together" in your join criteria. If we take a look at the tables on the previous slide, what data should be considered "matching" between the "depression\_scale" table and the "subject\_address" table? Write your answer in the chat.

--{{2}}--
Was the answer as simple as just matching on the subject id ("subj\_id")? 

### Combining Join type and criteria

You'll combine join type and join criteria by using both the `FROM` component and the `ON` or `USING` component.  Your SQL query might include lines that look something like this: 

```sql
SELECT 
  table_1.*    -- all the fields from table_1
  ,table_2.icd9     -- and a couple of fields 
  ,table_2.dx_date  -- we want from table_2 
FROM table_1 LEFT JOIN table_2
ON table_1.pat_id = table_2.pat_id;
```

--{{0}}--
This is the basic structure of a SQL join, including the type of join and the criteria we're using to match data across table 1 and table 2.  For the rest of this module we'll first talk about join types, then join criteria, and then we'll finish up with more examples to help you understand how these two elements of a join work together to give you the results you care about.

## Join Types

--{{0}}--
 Let's consider the gradebook example we mentioned earlier. We might have two tables, one called "math\_grades" and one called "language\_grades".  Some students appear in "math\_grades", some in "language\_grades", and some students have rows in both tables. 

Let's consider the gradebook example we mentioned earlier.

**math\_grades**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| student\_id  | math\_grade | semester |
| :--------- | :--------- | :------ |
| 11  | A | Jan-May 2023 |
| 12  | B | Jan-May 2023 |
| 13  | A | Sep-Dec 2022 |

**language\_grades**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| student\_id  | language\_grade | semester |
| :--------- | :--------- | :------ |
| 11 | C | Sep-Dec 2022 |
| 14 | B | Jan-May 2023 |
 
 --{{1}}--
 This can be represented by a Venn diagram where the left circle represents a group of students who appear in the math\_grades table and the right circle represents the group of students who appear in the language\_grades table. There's some overlap of these two circles, representing the subset of students who appear in both tables. There are 4 basic join types we'll talk about now.

 {{1}}
 *****

 We can visualize these groups of students using a Venn diagram with students in "math\_grades" on the left and students in "language\_grades" on the left.

 Depending on your purposes, you might want any one of several types of joins, each with its own SQL keyword combination. There are 4 basic join types that we'll talk about today:
*****

{{2}}
**`INNER JOIN`**.  ![Overlapping circles with only the inner, overlapping part highlighted](media/inner.png) 

{{3}}
**`LEFT JOIN`**.  ![Overlapping side-by-side circles with the left circle, including the overlapping part of the left circle, highlighted](media/left_outer.png) 

{{4}}
**`RIGHT JOIN`**.  ![Overlapping side-by-side circles with the right circle, including the overlapping part of the right circle, highlighted](media/right_outer.png)

{{5}}
**`FULL JOIN`**.  ![Overlapping circles with both circles highlighted](media/full_outer.png) 

### `INNER JOIN`

Here, let's consider the left table to be **math\_grades** and the right table to be **language\_grades**.

![Overlapping circles with only the inner, overlapping part highlighted](media/inner.png) 

--{{1}}--
An `INNER JOIN` (and this is the default behavior of `JOIN` without any modifying words) finds matching grade data falling in the "Both Math and Language Grades" overlap section.  This is often the data you want to capture. If you're conducting research on the correlation between math and language grades, this is the join you want.  If a student lacks one or the other grade, their data isn't useful to you, so you don't want it. The result of an inner join will be a table that only has rows of data for students who appear in both tables.  If a student is missing in one or the other table of grades, that student won't appear in your result set.

{{1}}
An `INNER JOIN`, finds the data falling in the "Both Math and Language Grades" overlap section (highlighted in blue above). This is the most frequently used join type, and will result in a table with only the students who have both math and language grades. 

{{2}}
*****

An `INNER JOIN` shows up in code like this:

```sql
...
FROM math_grades INNER JOIN language_grades
...
```

or

```sql
...
FROM math_grades JOIN language_grades
...
```
*****

{{3}}
******
<div class = "important">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Important note</b><br>

Note that the word `JOIN` by itself means `INNER JOIN`.  Make sure you remember that the default kind of join, without any keywords, is an inner join, which may or may not be what you want!
</div>
*****

### `LEFT JOIN`

--{{0}}--
Again, let's consider the left table to be **math\_grades** and the right table to be **language\_grades**.
A `LEFT JOIN` (or a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` as you'll sometimes see it) finds unmatched data in "Only Math Grades" -- that's the "outer" part on the left -- and also finds matching data in "Both Math and Language Grades" -- the overlap section.  It would exclude student data in the "Only Language Grades" section (which is on the right). Maybe you want this data because as the chair of the mathematics department, you want to see what students are strongest, in math, and also in language if known, in order to select who to award a math prize to.  Perhaps you'll use language grades as a tie-breaker, for example?

![Overlapping side-by-side circles with the left circle, including the overlapping part of the left circle, highlighted](media/left_outer.png) 


--{{1}}--
The result of a left join is a table which contains rows of data for students who only have math grades (and therefore appear in the left table) as well as rows of data for students who have math and language grades (and therefore appear in both tables), but no rows of data for students who only have language grades. When there is no matching data from the language table to join to the data from the math table, because the students don't have language grades, these cells in the table are empty, or `NULL`. 

{{1}}
*****

The result of a left join will be a table that has:

* Rows of data for students who appear in the left table only
* Rows of data for students who appear in both tables.
* `NULL` values (empty cells) when there's no matching data from the right table to join to the students who only appear in the left table
*****

--{{2}}--
A `LEFT JOIN` shows up in code like this.  Note that one table is listed first, and is therefore on the left, and the other table is listed second, and is therefore on the right (because English is written left to right). Note that unlike an inner join, you'll always need to specify that you are using a left join (though the "outer" need not be specified, depending on your preference).

{{2}}
*****

A `LEFT JOIN` shows up in code like this:

```sql
...
FROM math_grades LEFT JOIN language_grades
...
```

or

```sql
...
FROM math_grades LEFT OUTER JOIN language_grades
...
```
*****

### `RIGHT JOIN`

--{{0}}--
A `RIGHT JOIN` (or a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`) finds unmatched data in "Only Language Grades" -- that's the "outer" part on the right of the Venn diagram -- and also finds matching data in "Both Math and Language Grades" -- the overlap section.  It would exclude student data in the "Only Math Grades" section (which is on the left). Maybe you want this data to create a graph of language grade distribution, and want to enrich it with some statistics about math grades where available, but it doesn't matter if some students lack math grades. 

![Overlapping side-by-side circles with the right circle, including the overlapping part of the right circle, highlighted](media/right_outer.png) 

--{{1}}--
The result of a right join is a table which contains rows of data for students who only have language grades (and therefore appear in the right table) as well as rows of data for students who have language and math grades (and therefore appear in both tables), but no rows of data for students who only have math grades. When there is no matching data from the math table to join to the data from the language table, because the students don't have math grades, these cells in the table are empty, or `NULL`. 

{{1}}
*****

**Results:**
The result of a right join will be a table that has:

* Rows of data for students who appear in the right table only
* Rows of data for students who appear in both tables. 
* `NULL` values (empty cells) when there's no matching data from the left table to join to the students who only appear in the right table.
*****

--{{2}}--
A `RIGHT JOIN` shows up in code like this.  Recall that "left" and "right" refer to the order in which the table names are typed in the `FROM` statement, and "math grades" is our left table and "language grades" is our right table.

{{2}}
*****

A `RIGHT JOIN` shows up in code like this:

```sql
...
FROM math_grades RIGHT JOIN language_grades
...
```

or

```sql
...
FROM math_grades RIGHT OUTER JOIN language_grades
...
```
*****

--{{3}}--
You might not see a lot of right joins in code "in the wild", and that's because many people who write SQL code simply prefer to use all left joins! It's simple preference, it's not correct or incorrect practice. Because "right" and "left" simply refer to the order in which the tables are written in the FROM statement, you can re-write a right join into a left join by switching the order of the tables in the FROM statement. That way, you choose whether you use a right or left join (and this is often a left join by convention.)

{{3}}
*****

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

Because "right" and "left" in the join types simply refers to the order in which you write the tables in the `FROM` statement, it's easy to turn a right join into a left join:<br/><br/>

<code>
FROM math\_grades RIGHT JOIN language\_grades
</code>
<br/><br/>
Can be rewritten as: 
<br/><br/>
<code>
FROM language\_grades LEFT JOIN math\_grades
</code>
<br/><br/>

</div>
*****

### `FULL JOIN`

--{{0}}--
A `FULL JOIN` (or sometimes you'll see `FULL OUTER JOIN`) will consider all the data -- all of the outer, unmatched data on the right (language\_grades) and left (math\_grades) tables, as well as the inner overlapping data which has matching data from both tables. This kind of join is important if you want to create a grade book that shows student grades for each student, including their math grades and/or their language grades.  

![Overlapping circles with both circles highlighted](media/full_outer.png) 

--{{1}}--
The result of a full join will be a table that has rows of data for students that have only math grades (and therefore appear only in the left table), students that have only language grades (and therefore appear only in the right table), and student that have both grades (and therefore appear in both tables). When there's no matching data from the one of the tables to join to the data you included from the other table, `NULL` values (empty cells) are added. When there is no matching data from one table to join to the data from the other table, because the student doesn't have grades for both subjects, these cells in the table are empty, or `NULL`. 

{{1}}
*****
**Results:**
The result of a full join will be a table that has:

* Rows of data for students who appear in the left table only
* Rows of data for students who appear in both tables
* Rows of data for students who appear in the right table only.
* `NULL` values (empty cells) when there's no matching data from the one of the tables to join to the data you included from the other table.
*****

--{{2}}--
A `FULL JOIN` shows up in code like this. You can specify `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but just `FULL JOIN` means the same thing; which you choose will come down to preference. 

{{2}}
*****

A `FULL JOIN` shows up in code like this:

```sql
...
FROM math_grades FULL JOIN language_grades
...
```

or

```sql
...
FROM math_grades FULL OUTER JOIN language_grades
...
```
*****

### ðŸ’« **Your Turn: Join Types**

Consider the scenario of a table of math grades for 9th grade students and a table of language grades for 9th grade students.  Some 9th graders appear in both tables, but some appear only in one of them.  Fatima appears in the math\_grades table, but not in the language\_grades table.  When you perform a full outer join on these two tables, what will happen to Fatima's data in the resulting joined table?

[( )] Her data will not appear, since she's not represented in both tables.
[(X)] Her math grade will appear and she'll have a blank for her language grade.
[( )] The join command will fail, because a full join can only take place on fully overlapped tables.
[( )] The join command will fail because there's no such type of join as a full outer join.
****

<div class = "answer">

A full outer join is indeed a type of join, and it can take place on any two tables, whether they have a full or partial overlap or even no overlap at all.  In this example case, Fatima's data will appear in the results table, because regardless of whether the math\_grades table was written on the left or the right, a full outer join includes both the left and right tables' data.  We know her math grade, so that will appear, but since there's no matching data for Fatima in the language\_grades table, she'll have empty cells with `NULL` values for any columns that come from the language\_grades table.

</div>
****

## Join Criteria

Join criteria are conditions that mean that rows from two different tables belong together or "match".  For example, what makes a row from the math\_grades table match up with a row from the language\_grades table?

Your criteria might be something like:

* Join the rows from "depression\_scale" with rows from "subject\_address" **... but only if the subject ID field matches**
* Join the rows from "items" with the rows from "orders" **... but only if the item ID field matches**
* Join the rows from "biology\_grades" with the rows from "psychology\_grades" **... but only if the student ID is the same and the semester is the same**

When the conditions in your join criteria evaluate as TRUE for a row then a join will be performed for those rows, and when the join criteria are evaluated as FALSE no join for those rows will take place.

### Data Relationships

As a reminder, SQL is a **relational database**, so it's not surprising that we talk about data relationships in this module.  Equality is one kind of relationship, when two data points are identical, but other relationships, like "less than" or "between" will also prove useful when we set up our join criteria.

Join criteria will be some sort of relationship statement referencing data that occurs in both tables you want to join.  This relationship statement will be valuated to TRUE or FALSE when  your join is executed.  Often, the relationship is equality -- you're looking for a perfect match.  We'll start with equality, the most frequently used condition, on the next page. 

### Examples of Equality

**Example 1**

Do you have subject identifiers or student ID numbers in two different tables?  This shared information can be used to connect (join) data from these tables, based on the identifier being equal.  

For example, if the subject ID matches, a row from table A and a row from table B will be joined.  If the subject ID doesn't match, these rows won't be joined.  Maybe we're trying to match lung cancer occurrence and smoking exposure in the same row:

**disease**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE |
| 5 | FALSE  |
| 8  | FALSE |

**smoking**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 2  | 10 |
| 3 | 10  |
| 4  | 0 |


In code, we usually use an **ON** statement:

```sql
...
ON disease.subject_id = smoking.subject_id
```

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

In this case, we're comparing the equality of two fields that **have the same name**, so we could also use **USING**.  This special word only applies when you're looking for a perfect match between fields that have matching names, too.  It's okay if you never use `USING` and prefer to always stick with `ON`, which is more multi-purpose.

</div>

```sql
...
USING(subject_id)
```

With either of the above code snippets (`ON` or `USING`):

* subject 3 from disease **matches** with subject 3 from smoking 
* subject 5 from disease **doesn't match** with anyone in smoking 
* subject 8 from disease **doesn't match** with anyone from smoking 
* subject 2 from smoking **doesn't match** with anyone from disease 
* subject 4 from smoking **doesn't match** with anyone from disease 

{{1}}
*****

**Example 2**

Sometimes the data that appears in the two tables has the same field name, as we just saw on the previous page.  Sometimes, however, the data might be stored under different names.  Let's consider this example:

**math\_grades**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| student\_id  | math\_grade | semester |
| :--------- | :--------- | :------ |
| 11  | A | Jan-May 2023 |


**language\_grades**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| student\_id  | language\_grade | term |
| :--------- | :--------- | :------ |
| 11 | C | Sep-Dec 2022 |
| 14 | B | Jan-May 2023 |

Here, "semester" is used in math\_grades and "term" is used in language\_grades.  So you might also see something like:

```sql
...
ON math_grades.semester = language_grades.term
```

In this example:

* The A grade for Jan-May 2023 from math\_grades **matches** with the B grade for Jan-May 2023 in language\_grades (whoops, even though the student\_id doesn't match!)
* The C grade for Sep-Dec 2022 in language\_grades **does not match** with any row in math\_grades 

<div class = "help">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Troubleshooting help</b><br>

This highlights the importance of documenting your data so you can tell which fields hold which data in order to use them properly for joins.  If `semester` and `term` are  different things, not just the same thing with two different names, the result of your join will be disappointing.  <br/>

This also shows that figuring out your join criteria requires close attention: we probably don't mean to match student 11's math grades with student 14's language grades!
</div>
*****

### Non-Equality and More

Sometimes you don't need equality as your condition.  For example, in our example from our multi-site mental health research (see the first page of this module for a reminder), let's say we want to associate a particular depression score with a particular address only if the depression inventory was given between the start and end dates of residency at that address. In a case like that, you might see something like:

```sql
...
ON depression_scale.date BETWEEN 
   subject_address.date_start AND 
   subject_address.date_end
```

{{1}}
*****

**Multiple conditions**

Of course, in the example of the depression inventory, we'd also want to make sure that there was a match on subject identifier (you don't want to match Lakshmi's depression score with Larry's address, just because the dates worked!).  You can combine conditions too.  Here, we look for an exact match on subject ID and a date match that's between the correct dates:

```sql
...
ON depression_scale.subj_id = subject_address.subj_id AND
   depression_scale.date BETWEEN 
      subject_address.date_start AND 
      subject_address.date_end
```
*****

### Getting Really Complicated

Let's keep thinking about our depression inventories and our goal of matching depression scores to addresses in our study. What if some addresses don't have end dates?  This could be because the subject is currently still living there.  There are some addresses with `NULL` end dates in our data, so this isn't an academic question.

You can create arbitrarily complex **boolean logic** (or **boolean algebra**), using AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses as needed.  Much as in math, there's an order of operations in this kind of logic, and you might need several sets of parentheses to make sure you're applying the conditions correctly.  For example, see below.  We've added comments to help illustrate the logic.

```sql
...
ON depression_scale.subj_id = subject_address.subj_id AND 
-- subject ID must match... AND...

-- either:
   ((depression_scale.date BETWEEN          
      subject_address.date_start AND 
      subject_address.date_end) OR
-- the depression date is between a start and end, OR...

   (depression_scale.date > subject_address.date_start AND 
   subject_address.date_end IS NULL))                 
-- the depression date is after the start date,
-- and there's no end date.
```

Let's take this more comprehensive example and look at the example tables from the first page of this module:

**depression\_scale**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style="font-size:80%"-->
| subj\_id  | date  | dep\_q1  | dep\_q2   | dep\_q3  | dep\_q4  | dep\_total   |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 11234   | 2021-05-15   | 3    | 3  | 2    | 4    | 12    |
| 86234   | 2021-06-01   | 4    | 4  | 3    | 4    | 15    |
| 32660   | 2021-06-10   | 1    | 1  | 2    | 1    | 5   |
| 86234   | 2022-01-13   | 2    | 2  | 1    | 3    | 8    |
| 41356   | 2022-02-10   | 1    | 3  | 2    | 3    | 10   |

**subject\_address**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style="font-size:80%"-->
| subj\_id  | street\_address  | city  | state   | zip  | date\_start  | date\_end   |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 11234   | 123 Main Street   | Smithtown    | PA  | 19000    | 2022-01-01   | `NULL`    |
| 11234   | 123 Oak Lane   | Old Towne    | PA  | 18000   | 2000-01-01    | 2021-12-31    |
| 93452   | 123 Green Blvd  | Kirby    | TN  | 37000    | 2020-05-01    | `NULL`   |

With this most recent join criteria:

* The depression score (dep\_total) for subject 11234, measured on 2021-05-15, **matches** with the address 123 Oak Lane for the same subject and time period. 
* The depression score (dep\_total) for subject 11234, measured on 2021-05-15, will **not match** with the address 123 Main Street for the same subject, because the time period doesn't match. 
* The other rows in the depression\_scale **don't match** with any rows in the subject\_address table. 
* The first and third rows of the subject\_address table **don't match** with any rows in the depression\_scale table. 

### Using Other SQL Commands

Especially for one-to-many data relationships, you might want to create a simplified table temporarily in order to have that be part of a join.  This means you may have to also do some complicated things like using `GROUP BY` with aggregation, using `WHERE` and/or `HAVING`, or creating subqueries.  

For example, let's say you want to only use the earliest depression inventory for each subject, not any subsequent depression inventories, for your analysis of the correlation between depression score and zip code.  Then you want to join that earliest depression inventory with the address of the subject at the time of administration of that earliest inventory.  That's a lot of logic!  The easiest way to do that is to first create a simplified table that only contains the earliest depression inventory for each subject id.  This is a great place to use `GROUP BY` and the aggregation function `MIN()` to find the earliest date of administration.  Then you can use that simpler table to join to subject addresses.  

We won't show the code for this in this module, but be aware that you can think about complex joins by first planning how you can simplify a table to make the logic easier to work with!

### ðŸ’« **Your Turn: Join Criteria**

True or False: a matching ID (like student\_id or patient\_id) is generally sufficient as a join criterion.

[( )] True
[(X)] False
****
<div class = "answer">

Often, a matching identifier is part of what makes up good join criteria, but it may not be sufficient on its own.  For example, consider trying to link patient diagnoses with medication orders.  Patients can appear dozens or hundreds of times across decades, so to correctly link diagnoses with medications, it's not sufficient to rely just on patient id.  You might need to use an "encounter id", a date range, or another join criteria to make sure you're matching data that really belongs together (instead of joining Mary's diagnosis of diaper rash when she was 3 months old to her prescription of Ritalin at age 9).

</div>
****

## Combining It All

In the next few sections, we'll combine our join type and join criteria, to show you how these work together.  

And, since you have lots of reference pages to look back at, we are confident that you'll be able to write the code yourself!  

<div class = "care">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">A little encouragement...</b><br>

Don't worry, we'll scaffold the code for you so you have the support you need to write the SQL code.  And if you don't get it right the first time, you can try a few times.  Still stuck?  You can click the "check" icon to show the answer!

</div>

You'll use a `FROM` statement, which describes the type of join, and an `ON` statement, which describes the join criteria.

Importantly, we will only presesent a few examples.  There are many combinations we could consider, at all levels of complexity.  Here are a few we **won't** do:

* A `LEFT JOIN` involving tables which require a "between" type relationship (like a "spend" value between a "budget\_floor" value and a "budget\_ceiling" value)
* An `INNER JOIN` involving equality matching on three fields: two identifiers and one date field
* A `RIGHT JOIN` involving matching data with a "less than" relationship, such as a 3 month old weight measurement being less than a 1 month old weight measurement
* and many more!

Instead of being exhaustive, we've concentrated on the most frequent use case you'll encounter over and over: equality.  We'll go over each join type (inner, left, right, and full) on a simple equality matching a single field from each table.

### `INNER JOIN` and Equality Condition

To understand what an `INNER JOIN` with equality looks and acts like practically, let's go to a simple example of two tables we used earlier in this module:

**disease**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE |
| 5 | FALSE  |
| 8  | FALSE |

**smoking**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 2  | 10 |
| 3 | 10  |
| 4  | 0 |

Let's perform an inner join on these two tables.  To do this, we have to combine join criteria (subject\_id matching) with join type (inner).   

We've taken care of the join criteria, but we need you to add the join type.  Please add the `FROM` statement in the partial SQL code below.  You'll need two table names separated by some kind of `JOIN` command.  For now, leave the `ON` code unchanged. Think about what rows you expect to see in your result set before you run any code.

When you want to see the results of your code, click on the "play" button below the code block.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ...
ON disease.subject_id = smoking.subject_id;
```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable19a")

<lia-keep><table id="dataTable19a" border="1"></table><br></lia-keep>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_disease

@AlaSQL.buildTable_smoking

</div>

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

Once you've gotten your code to work, you might want to try the following variations.  How do they change your results?  Or do they?  

* Swap the order of the tables 
* Add or delete the `INNER` keyword before `JOIN`

</div>

<details>

<summary>**Still stuck?  Click to see our solution!**</summary>

<br/>

<div class = "answer">

Here's the code we used:

```sql
SELECT *

```

This is the result we got. 

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE | 10 |

Our resulting dataset only includes data for subjects appearing in both tables.

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>
Did you notice that we used `JOIN` by itself here, without any other keywords?  `JOIN` by itself means `INNER JOIN`.

### `LEFT JOIN` and Equality Condition

To understand what a `LEFT JOIN` with equality looks and acts like practically, let's again go to that same simple example of two tables we used earlier in this module:

**disease**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE |
| 5 | FALSE  |
| 8  | FALSE |

**smoking**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 2  | 10 |
| 3 | 10  |
| 4  | 0 |

Again let's combine our join criteria (subject\_id matching) with our join type (this time, a left join).  We'll make **disease** the left table and **smoking** the right table.  Think about what rows you expect to see in your result set before you run any code.

We're going to make things a bit harder.  Please add both the `FROM` and the `ON` code sections to the SQL code!  For now, use `ON`, and don't try `USING` just yet.

When you want to see the results of your code, click on the "play" button below the code block.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ...
ON ...
```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable20a")

<lia-keep><table id="dataTable20a" border="1"></table><br></lia-keep>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_disease

@AlaSQL.buildTable_smoking

</div>

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>

Once you've got that code working, you might want to try `USING`.  The SQL dialect we're using here, AlaSQL, uses the word `USING` without parentheses.  So, while in many SQL dialects you would type `USING(subject_id)`, in this module, try `USING subject_id`.  Put `USING subject_id` in place of the `ON` statement to see if there are any changes in your result set!

</div>

<br/>

<div class = "answer">

Here's the code we used:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM disease LEFT JOIN smoking
ON disease.subject_id = smoking.subject_id;
```

This is the result we got.  We have a row for each item of data in the left table, enriched where possible with data from the right table.  Below, we've added `NULL` to show empty cells, but in your results from running SQL code you'll just see blanks.  

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE | 10 |
| 5 | FALSE  | `NULL` |
| 8  | FALSE | `NULL` |

When there's no matching data from the right table to join to the data you included from the left, `NULL` values (empty cells) are added.

<div class = "options">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Another option</b><br>
We could have also used `USING`, and the following code would have given us the same results:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM disease LEFT JOIN smoking
USING subject_id;
```


</div>

</div>

</details>

### `RIGHT JOIN` and Equality Condition

To understand what a `RIGHT JOIN` with equality looks and acts like practically, let's again use our example tables:

**disease**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE |
| 5 | FALSE  |
| 8  | FALSE |

**smoking**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 2  | 10 |
| 3 | 10  |
| 4  | 0 |

You'll now combine our join criteria (subject\_id matching) with our join type (right).  Please use the **disease** table as the left table and the **smoking** table as the right table.

```sql
SELECT *

```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable21a")

<lia-keep><table id="dataTable21a" border="1"></table><br></lia-keep>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_disease

@AlaSQL.buildTable_smoking

</div>


--------

<details>

<summary>**Still stuck?  Click to see our solution!**</summary>

<br/>

<div class = "answer">

Here's the code we used:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM disease RIGHT JOIN smoking
ON disease.subject_id = smoking.subject_id;
```

This is the result we would get.  We're including all the data from the right table, enriched where possible with data from the left table.  Below, we've added `NULL` to show empty cells, but in your results from running SQL code you'll just see blanks. 

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3 | TRUE | 10  |
| 2  | `NULL` | 10 |
| 4  | `NULL` | 0 |

When there's no matching data from the left table to join to the data you included from the right, `NULL` values (empty cells) are added.

</div>

</details>

### `FULL JOIN` and Equality Condition

To understand what a `FULL JOIN` with equality looks and acts like practically, let's go, one last time, to our example tables:

**disease**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE |
| 5 | FALSE  |
| 8  | FALSE |

**smoking**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | 
| 2  | 10 |
| 3 | 10  |
| 4  | 0 |

And let's combine our join criteria (subject\_id matching) with our join type (full).  This time, we're going to have you write the entire query! 

<div class = "important">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Important note</b><br>

Different SQL dialects have different quirks.  We explained earlier, for example, that the SQL running behind the scenes in this module (AlaSQL) expects the `USING` keyword to appear without parentheses. 

There's another important difference we want to point out here: AlaSQL **requires that you use `FULL OUTER JOIN` instead of just `FULL JOIN`.** That's not the case for every dialect of SQL, but here, please use `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

</div>

```sql

```
@AlaSQL.eval("#dataTable22a")

<lia-keep><table id="dataTable22a" border="1"></table><br></lia-keep>

<div style = "display:none;">

@AlaSQL.buildTable_disease

@AlaSQL.buildTable_smoking

</div>

--------

<details>

<summary>**Still stuck?  Click to see our solution!**</summary>

<br/>

<div class = "answer">

Here's the code we used:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM disease FULL OUTER JOIN smoking
ON disease.subject_id = smoking.subject_id;
```

This is the result we would get.  Each subject is represented here, both the ones who appear in the left table and in the right table. Below, we've added `NULL` to show empty cells, but in your results from running SQL code you'll just see blanks. 

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"-->
| subject\_id  | lung\_cancer | smoking\_pack\_years |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | 
| 3  | TRUE | 10 |
| 5 | FALSE  | `NULL` |
| 8  | FALSE | `NULL` |
| 2  | `NULL` | 10 |
| 4  | `NULL` | 0 |

When there's no matching data from the one of the tables to join to the data you included from the other table, `NULL` values (empty cells) are added.  

</div>
