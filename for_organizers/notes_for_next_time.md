This is a (publicly visible) place for us to record notes for organizers about things to keep/change/consider for the next time we run this series: 

# Notes from 2024 workshops

- Basics runs long. We might want to break it into two talks (and add back in some of the material from the module we're currently skipping)
- Joins runs long. It would be hard to split the content up, but maybe we could run this one as a double-long session -- that would also allow more time for hands on practice, which would be great.
