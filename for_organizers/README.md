This directory is for workshop organizers, rather than learners (keep in mind, though, that this is still a public repository and everything here is visible to anyone).

# Tips for presenting

We use **liascript** for slides and **Teams** for meetings.

## Liascript slides

The following settings in the liascript header are very important: 

```
mode: Presentation
@onload: window.LIA.settings.sound = false
```

These set the slides to display in slide mode (vs. textbook), and prevent the browser from automatically reading the speaker notes out loud, which is otherwise the default.
