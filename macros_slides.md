**Do you have an Arcus Lab, or are you thinking about starting one?**

Get hands-on practice working with real patient data in an Arcus On-Ramp workshop!

--{{0}}--
We offer three different Arcus On-Ramp workshops, each focused on a different aspect of doing research in Arcus. 
We offer these on a regular, rotating basis all year.

<ul>
  <li>Arcus On-Ramp: Build your SQL Query</li>
  <li>Arcus On-Ramp: Analysis in R</li>
  <li>Arcus On-Ramp: Analysis in Python </li>
</ul>

[See available dates and sign up for an Arcus On-Ramp workshop](https://arcus.chop.edu/education/webinar-signup). The next SQL On-Ramp is **Nov 20th**.

--{{0}}--
The Arcus On-Ramp workshops are different from these skill series workshops in two big ways: First, although the Arcus On-Ramp workshops use tools like SQL, R, and Python, the focus is on how to work in an Arcus Lab, not learning those languages per se. 
And secondly, because the On-Ramp workshops use real patient data, unlike today's workshop, you need to have completed CITI training and attested the Arcus terms of use before you can sign up.

If you're feeling like you'd like a realistic, worked example of how SQL might be used in an Arcus Lab to answer a research question, then the Arcus On-Ramp is for you!

@about_these_slides

These slides were created with [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/), an open source markdown parser for writing educational content.

All of the speaker notes from today's talk are saved in [the slides themselves](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/arcus_skill_series_sql/main/database_normalization/database_normalization.md#1) -- try changing the view to Textbook and it will integrate the text from the notes into the slides themselves, or turn on the sound at the bottom to hear the notes read out loud as you go through.

The best way to learn is to practice!

When we reach ðŸ’« **Your Turn** sections, test your knowledge and respond in the Teams poll or the chat section.
Then we'll discuss the answer together.
