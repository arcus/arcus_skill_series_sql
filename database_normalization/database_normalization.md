title: Database Normalization
comment: Learn about the concept of normalization and why it's important for organizing complicated data in relational databases.
long_description: Usually, data in a relational database like SQL is organized into multiple interrelated tables with as little data repetition as possible. This concept can be useful to apply in other areas as well, such as organizing data in .csvs or in data frames in R or Python.  This module teaches underlying data considerations and explains how data can be efficiently organized by introducing the concepts of one-to-many data relationships and normalization.
estimated_time_in_minutes: 40

@pre_reqs
Learners should have experience working with data in tables.  This could included working with .csv files, SQL databases, R data frames, REDCap instruments, or other ways that data can be collected in tables. 
@end

@learning_objectives  
After completion of this module, learners will be able to:

- Explain the significance of "one to many" data relationships and how these relationships affect data organization
- Describe how a normalized database is typically organized
- Explain how data can be linked between tables and define "primary keys" and "foreign keys"

# Database Normalization

Welcome everyone! 
I‚Äôm Joy Payton and I use she/her pronouns. 
I‚Äôm a data science educator with the Arcus project in DBHI, the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. 
Today‚Äôs talk is the second in a series of talks about ‚Äúsequel‚Äù, S-Q-L, that we‚Äôll be offering over the next several months.
We‚Äôre going to be recording today‚Äôs webinar, so please leave your cameras and mics turned off until the question time at the end.
We‚Äôll give some time with the recording turned off, so that you can ask questions and not worry about being recorded. If you do have questions that come up during the talk, please feel free to put them in the chat, and I‚Äôll keep an eye on the chat to see what comes up.
With that let‚Äôs get started!

## Today's talk 

@todays_talk

--{{0}}--
Today in our webinar, we will be talking about why SQL data is structured in interrelated tables, and why that is both useful and can be a bit challenging for newcomers to SQL. 
We will not be doing any hands-on coding with SQL today.  However, in future sessions in this series, that **will** be available to you.
After this session, we believe that you will be able to do the following three things:
You will be able to explain the significance of one-to-many data relationships, and how these relationships affect data organization.
You will be able to describe how a normalized database is typically organized (and don‚Äôt worry if the phrase ‚Äúnormalized database‚Äù is foreign to you, we will talk about that!)
And finally we believe you will be able to explain how data can be linked between tables, and in so doing, be able to define ‚Äúprimary keys‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign keys‚Äù.

## Thank you!

<div class = "gratitude">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Thank you!</b><br>

Material for this talk is based closely on the DART module [Database Normalization](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/education_modules/main/database_normalization/database_normalization.md), written by Joy Payton and funded by National Institutes of Health award number 5R25GM141501.

Now, it feels weird to thank myself as the author of the module that this talk is based on, but I do think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge authors.  And of course we also want to express gratitude to NIH for funding our data education efforts in our R25 grant, which is the project that gave rise to the source materials we will be using throughout these series for the next few months.

## Learn by doing

@teams_polls

--{{0}}--
Today‚Äôs presentation will include interactive content. We are firm believers that the best way to learn is to **practice**, so I‚Äôm going to ask you to be active learners today. 
We will not have any hands-on coding practice today, but we will have short quizzes that come up to help you check your understanding.
And I‚Äôll also ask you to contribute your thinking about some questions I‚Äôm going to pose by typing into chat.  I will warn you ahead of time that I‚Äôm about to ask for your participation, and I really encourage you to make the best use of your time and jump in and participate.


## Quick Review

* SQL = "Structured Query Language" and is a language used to request data from a relational database.
* Relational databases organize data in tables that are interrelated (e.g. subject ID)
* Tables have columns (aka fields) and rows.

Today, we're going to talk about how data is organized in relational databases, and why you have to use multiple tables for just about everything interesting you want to do with data.

--{{0}}--
Let‚Äôs do a little short review of last month‚Äôs topic. Last month's topic was ‚ÄúDemystifying SQL‚Äù, which was a brief introduction to what SQL is for people who have never heard of it or who have heard of it but know very little about it. 
I‚Äôm not going to go in depth in reviewing last month's session. [If available: I will include a link to the recording of last month‚Äôs session so you can watch this on your own if you choose.]
In terms of review, I want to hit on three main takeaways from our first topic from November, and they are as follows:
First, S-Q-L or ‚Äúsequel‚Äù, and you can say it either way, SQL stands for ‚Äústructured query language‚Äù and it is a language used to request data ‚Äì  to make queries ‚Äì  from a relational database. What is a relational database?
The next bullet point speaks to that!  Relational databases are ways that we organize data in tables that are interrelated.  There might be, for example, a subject ID that appears in several different tables, and that shows the relationship between those tables, and that‚Äôs what makes a database a **relational** database.
And finally, tables have columns ‚Äì  and sometimes we call those fields ‚Äì  and tables also have rows.
That‚Äôs what we went over last month. Again, in this session today, we‚Äôre going to talk about how data is organized in these relational databases and why it is that you have to use multiple tables ‚Äì not just one table, but multiple tables ‚Äì  for just about everything interesting you want to do with data from a database.
Often you have to combine data from two or more tables to get the information you need for your work, and this can be frustrating if you are accustomed to getting a CSV for analysis.  If one spreadsheet, one table, is what you‚Äôre accustomed to working with, having more than one table to deal with can be annoying!  Therefore, I want to start by giving a use case that illustrates why getting data from multiple tables is important, and then we'll talk about why it's not practical to store medical data in a single table.


## Multiple Tables

Often, you have to combine data from two (or more!) tables to get the information you need.

Let‚Äôs start with a use case that explains this situation.  In the example on your screen, consider the case where you have data about depression. You are studying depression in research subjects who live in different areas, and you have lots of tables of data, but we‚Äôre just showing a sample.  One of these tables holds depression scores for subjects. This looks like it is a four question psychometric scale, with a total depression score, in a table that is called ‚Äúdepression scale‚Äù. Then we have a different table that holds subject addresses.
I‚Äôm going to ask for your participation now.
Let‚Äôs posit that your hypothesis is that people who live in certain ZIP Codes ‚Äì maybe ZIP Codes that experience more socioeconomic challenges ‚Äì those folks have higher rates of depression.   If you had this hypothesis, that ZIP Code was linked to depression, which columns would you need to look at in each of these tables?  When you have an idea of what you think you would want to look at in each table, share that in chat.
[Respond appropriately, e.g., OK great I see some good answers here, some thoughtful answers about what data you would need.]
I would argue that to see if your hypothesis has evidence to back it, you need to combine data from two tables.  From the depression scale, table, you would need the subject ID and the depression total score. And then from the addresses table, you would need the subject ID and the ZIP Code.  That‚Äôs the data that you would need to analyze to see if your hypothesis about ZIP Codes affecting depression is supported by the evidence.


## Multiple Tables

<div style="width: 50%; float:left;">

What you'd like, instead of two tables: a table with a subject identifier, depression score total, and zip code.  One research subject per row -- stats ready.

Why can't you get "everything all on one row" in a **single table** in the originating database?  Then you could just pull the three columns and be done.  Why is data fragmented into several tables?

</div>
<div style="width: 50%; float:left; padding: 0em 2em;">


**What you want to get to:**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" -->
| subj_id  |  dep_total | zip |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | 
| 123 | 3 | 19000 |
| 456 | 15 | 18000 |
| 789 | 12 | 18000 |
| ... | ... | ... |

</div>


Let's talk **database normalization**, which requires talking about **one-to-many** relationships.

--{{0}}--
What you might want to eventually end up with would be a single table of results that might just have three columns, the subject ID the depression total score might be a second column, and the third column could be ZIP Code And that way you have all your data in one place and you can look at the relationship between depression, score and ZIP Code.
You may be asking yourself, and you may have asked yourself in the past when you‚Äôve requested data, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt the people who are collecting this data or the people designing the database just put all of the information about each patient (or each research subject, or each sample or each animal model) ‚Äì  why don‚Äôt they put all of that information together in one table to start with?‚Äù
After all, getting one row per subject is how we usually prepare for applying statistical tests, so it would be great if we could just **start** with one row per patient or one row per research subject with everything we need across the columns.  If we started with that, we would be ready to jump into the science, and we would not have to do so much data preparation work. 
So why isn‚Äôt it that way when you work with databases?
The reason why this usually doesn‚Äôt happen in a database and instead see lots of different tables that you have to pull data from and join together is because of a concept known as **normalization**, and to explain normalization, we will first need to talk about **one-to-many data relationships**.


## One-to-Many

**Hospital one-to-many examples**

* One patient has multiple encounters on different dates.
* One encounter may include multiple orders for different procedures and medications.
* One medication order can give rise to multiple medication administrations.

**Retail website one-to-many examples**

* One customer may have several associated addresses for shipping, billing, or both.
* One customer will probably have multiple orders.
* Each order will have one or many associated items.

The "many" in one-to-many relationships is an unpredictable quantity!

--{{0}}--
Medicine often has one-to-many data relationships.
What does one-to-many mean?  I think the best way may be to consider a couple of use cases.
Consider a hospital and a retail website.  Each organization has one-to-many data relationships.
In a hospital, for example, one patient has multiple encounters on different dates.  One encounter may include multiple orders for different procedures or medications. One medication order can give rise to multiple medication administrations‚Ä¶. and you can probably think of a lot more examples of one-to-many data relationships in medicine.
Or in a retail website, one customer may have several associated addresses ‚Äì for shipping, or billing, or both. One customer will probably have multiple orders, and each order can have one or many associated items in that order.
A one-to-many data relationship is one in which one X is related to more than one Y, and these can be very hard to accommodate in a single table with all of the data included.
Let‚Äôs exercise our imagination a little bit.
Imagine that for an online store, you tried to construct a table of order information in which a single row represented an order.  Each order is one row, and in that row you want to include every single item included in that order.  
Maybe you start with five columns:  item one, item two, item three, item four, item five.  But there will be people that have more than five items in their order! 
So maybe you have 100 columns for the first item in the order, the second, the third, etc., all the way to the 99th and the 100th. But then maybe somebody orders 110 items!  What do we do with that?  It‚Äôs hard to know how many columns to provision to begin with.  
Also, many times, orders are much smaller. Many orders will just be one or two items, so they‚Äôre not taking advantage of all of those empty cells for those hundred columns that you created.  That‚Äôs not an efficient way to store data!


## Quiz: One-to-Many 

Which of the following relationships are likely to be one-to-many?  Select all the correct answers.

[[X]] Gym member to workout
[[ ]] Street address to latitude and longitude coordinates
[[X]] Patient to medical provider
[[X]] Medical provider to patient
[[ ]] Baseball team to mascot
[[?]] There are multiple correct answers!
*********

<div class = "answer">

We hope that any gym member will have more than one recorded workout, so that relationship is one-to-many.  However, a particular street address will only be related to a single latitude and longitude. That's not a one-to-many relationship.  A patient can have multiple providers, so that's one-to-many, and providers can have many patients, so that's also one-to-many.  In fact you could more accurately call this relationship many-to-many!  Finally, a baseball team (we argue) should have only one mascot, so that's not a one-to-many relationship.

</div>

***********

--{{0}}--
Let‚Äôs pause here. I am going to ask for your participation and bring up a poll in teams, and I‚Äôd like to ask you which of the following relationships are likely to be one to many relationships.  There is more than one correct answer.   Please give that a read, and tell me what you think!
[Respond appropriately, e.g.:  All right, thank you so much for your participation. A lot of you are exactly right, I see a good pattern of responses here.]
So, we hope that any gym member will have more than one recorded work out. That‚Äôs the goal anyway!  Therefore, that relationship is one-to-many.
However, a particular street address will only be related to a single latitude and longitude, so that is not a one-to-many relationship. That is a one-to-one relationship.
A patient can have multiple providers, so that‚Äôs one-to-many, and providers certainly have many patients so that‚Äôs also one-to-many.  In fact, you could really call the relationship between patient and provider many-to-many.
And finally, this is a little silly, but we would argue that a baseball team should have at most one mascot, not multiple, so that is a one-to-one relationship, not a one one-to-many relationship.

Let‚Äôs again consider the data from our fictional multisite research study on mental health, and I‚Äôm going to ask for your participation here.  Take a moment and notice where are there one-to-many relationships in this data.  Type what you see in terms of these one-to-many relationships into the chat.
[Respond appropriately, e.g.:  Great you guys got it!]
We see that the subject with the identifier 86234 has two different administrations of the depression inventory on two different dates, and the subject with the identifier 11234 has two different addresses for two different date ranges.
This kind of repetition is not unrealistic in research and in medicine. Our patients and our research subjects might retake psychometric surveys, and they certainly move to new addresses.
Now let‚Äôs take a moment to consider how the one to many relationships make it really hard to try to smush data together in a single table.  We can start with combining the data in two tables.  

## Row Repetition Woes

What would combining these two tables look like, potentially?

If you were to try to combine, let‚Äôs say, demographic data and depression scale data into one table, you‚Äôd start to run into some issues related to the efficient storage of data and data repetition.  Take a few moments, and maybe even grab a pencil and paper, to draw up what you think the combined table might look like.  How many columns would it have?  How many rows?  Please think about if any of the one-to-many data relationships here might mean that we end up repeating ourselves when we combine these two tables into one!  I'll pause here to allow you to think about that!
OK, now let's go to what I think the combined data might look like.

One of the things that you‚Äôre going to encounter is that the demographic data for a given subject is **the same** for each time they take the depression inventory.  That is, their date of birth doesn‚Äôt change, their sex doesn‚Äôt change, and their race doesn‚Äôt change from the first to the second to the third to the fourth Instance that they take the depression inventory.
Is there duplicated data in this table?  Yes!
Here it doesn‚Äôt look that bad, it‚Äôs just subject 86234 who has repeated demographic data, but in a more realistic table, you might have many more rows of repeated data.  
For a given subject, you might have have four or five or 10 rows in which the demographic data is repeated. That‚Äôs a lot of data repetition.  That takes up space, and it can be tricky because if we realize that there‚Äôs an error in the date of birth then we have to find **all of the rows** that that date of birth appears on and correct it, and it could be easy to accidentally miss one.
We also have rows with partial data.  We have a subject here, 93452, for whom we have demographic information, but who lacks a depression screening, and that means some empty cells.  That‚Äôs not a huge deal, but it is a bit inefficient.

Often, however, people would like *all* the data on a given patient or a given research subject all in a single row.  That‚Äôs even more complicated!  Let‚Äôs say that there are three tables that you asked to combine: demographics, depression scale, and subject addresses. 
I‚Äôm going to ask for your participation, so take a moment and try to imagine how you would respond if you were working with a colleague or a supervisor who asked you to combine *all* the data you see here such that each research subject has one and only one row in the final table.
Type into chat some of the problems you foresee, or some of the questions you might ask.  I'll pause to let you try to sketch out or imagine how you might combine all of this data into a table that had one row per subject, with all of the information we know about that subject enclosed in that row.
[Respond appropriately, like: Yes, these are some good points you‚Äôre all making!]
In this case, we know that our subjects can have more than one address.  So how do we accommodate our subjects with more than one address, if we want to put everything about that subject in one row? We‚Äôre going to need more columns to account for multiple addresses.  Maybe we could have two sets of columns for addresses, like street address one and city one, street address two and city two, and so on.
But this is a longitudinal study, so people might move three times, or even 10 times! Who knows? Do we need to add 10 sets of address columns to make sure that we get all possible addresses included?
It‚Äôs hard to know ahead of time how many columns we would need.
And the same problem emerges when we have multiple administrations of the depression inventory. What if some people take the depression inventory five times? Keep in mind the depression inventory is four questions and a total, so that‚Äôs five columns for each instance of the depression inventory.  Are we going to repeat those five columns 5 or 10 times so that we have enough columns to allow for multiple retakes?  This is a huge issue!
If we try to combine data that can repeat into a one row per subject model, we do not know how many columns to create.


## One Table?  Not a Good Idea!

In short, if we try to force all the data we care about into a single table, we have a problem of **unpredictable number of columns** and **data repetition in rows**.  This makes maintaining, cleaning, correcting, and understanding data very tricky.

That's why we **normalize**. 

When data is normalized, we **organize data** in tables in such a way that we reduce needless data duplication, unpredictability, and empty cells. 

--{{0}}--
In short, I hope I‚Äôve managed to convince you here that if we take all the data that we know about someone and we try and force all of that data into a single table, we have a lot of problems. 
We have a problem of potential data repetition where we have the same information repeating row after row after row, and, depending on how we organize our data, we may also have the problem of an unpredictable number of columns.
These problems makes it tricky to maintain data and correct any errors, and it can make analysis very hard.  We‚Äôre much better off collecting various groups of facts about our patients, or our research subjects, or our animal models into distinct, separate tables.   You may have seen in the past things like a demographics table, an address table, a procedures table, a diagnosis table, and so on.  In each of these tables we‚Äôll have an ID column, such as a subject, ID or patient ID that would allow us to link the rows from different tables to one another and understand who we‚Äôre talking about.
This is the core of normalization ‚Äì dividing data into tables that each represent a specific concept.  The concept of demographics, the concept of address, the concept of procedure‚Ä¶  when data is normalized, we organize the data into tables in such a way that we reduce needless data duplication, we reduce unpredictability of not knowing how many columns we‚Äôre going to need, and we reduce the number of empty cells and waste in our data.

## Normalization

<div class = "behind-the-scenes">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Behind the scenes</b><br>
In this session, we're discussing a kind of normalization called "third normal form", often abbreviated 3NF.  The theory behind normalization has its own challenging jargon, like "cardinality", "atomicity", "decomposition", etc.  If you get excited by database optimization and information science, you might enjoy a deep dive into normalization.  But for most of us, we only need to develop a **casual understanding** of how normalization affects our databases. 
</div>


* **Normalization**: Organizes data into tables, each of which represents a specific **entity** or concept.
* **Entity tables** : Tables that represent concepts like "address" or "medication".  Each row of an entity table will have its own ID.

--{{0}}--
On your screen now you‚Äôre going to see a little bit of behind the scenes that gives more information, but only if you‚Äôre extra interested in this topic.  For most of us, we do not need this level of detail, but I wanted to add some context here for people who want to do some deeper learning on their own.
In short, normalization is a complex information science topic, and there are various levels of normalization that can be performed.  Here we will not go into details about these various forms of normalization. We‚Äôre just going to talk about what normalization **looks like** more than what it **is** in information science terms. You do not need to remember that there are different kinds of normalization. This is just extra information for those of you who want to go deeper.
In a normalized database, we separate data into tables, and these tables represent different logical **concepts** or **entities** like address, procedure, medication, patient, device, etc.
We tend to only include in these tables the data elements that have a single value that is relatively stable.  For instance, for a particular medication, the generic name is not likely to change very often if at all.  In the case of a device, a device probably has just one barcode sticker on it and it‚Äôs not going to change very often.  A patient date of birth should be singular and unchanging.  A medical procedure will have one billing code associated with it, and again, that will change very frequently. Those singular, stable elements are usually the kind of things that go in these entity tables.  We may exclude things from entity tables that can have multiple values or change frequently.  So for example, we probably would not have the the name of the insurance company providing coverage for a patient in the patient table right because patients will change their insurance or have multiple carriers.  That concept, of insurance carrier, doesn‚Äôt adhere to patients strongly ‚Äì it can change a lot.  Therefore, in the patient table we‚Äôre really going to only include things that are really closely adhering to the patient themselves, not accidental things that can change.
In these entity tables, whether it‚Äôs a device table or a patient table or a procedure table, we give each of the instances, each device, or patient, or procedure, a unique identifier.  It would be something like device ID or medication ID or patient ID or provider ID.

## Primary Keys and IDS


* **Primary Key**: An ID that's ***uniquely*** identifying for a given entity

------

**medication**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style=""-->
| med_id (PK) |  brand_name | generic_name | class |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 123 | Motrin | ibuprofen | NSAID |
| 249 | Prozac | fluoxetine | SSRI |
| 912 | Moxatag | amoxicillin | penicillinase-sensitive penicillin |

--{{0}}--
So far, we know we have tables that describe entities like ‚Äúmedication‚Äù or ‚Äúpatient‚Äù, and each of these tables has an ID associated that uniquely identifies each example of this entity ‚Äì each medication, or each patient.  A unique ID like this that can only occur once in a table is a primary key.
And that‚Äôs a vocabulary alert!
A primary key is an identifier that is linked to one and only one row in an entity table.  For example, the patient ID.  A given patient ID links to one and only one patient.
A medication ID adheres to one and only one medication.
For those of you who are already using SQL it‚Äôs helpful to know that if you define an identifier as a primary key, SQL will enforce this. It will not allow you to add a new row with the same ID.  For example, if you‚Äôve said hey, the field called patient_id is a primary key, SQL will not let you accidentally give the same ID to a new patient once that ID has already been assigned to someone.  If it‚Äôs a primary key, that ID should only occur once in the patient table, and can‚Äôt be added a second time.
In the table you see on your screen, you can see that this is a medication table, and there is a primary key, which is indicated with the letters PK. Lot of SQL systems will indicate that an identifier is a primary key with either a special symbol like a little icon of a key, or the letters PK for primary key. 
Because med_id is a primary key, we know that medication 123 can only occur one time in the whole table and in this case it‚Äôs Motrin. No other medication can be added with that same medication ID. 


## Interactions: How do Entities Interact?

What are some common interactions **between entities**?  These will become tables, too!

One kind of interaction between a provider, a patient, and a medication :  `medication_order`


<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style=""-->
| med\_order\_id (PK) |  pat_id | med_id | provider_id | order_date | .... | notes |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 322513 | 861201243 | 123 | 491212292 | 2023-05-01 | ... | PRN, advised parents |
| 322987 | 151242990 | 345 | 491212292 | 2023-07-10 | ... ||
| 323422 | 151242990 | 923 | 772916385 | 2023-09-23 | ... | supervise closely, choking risk |

--{{0}}-- 
Once we have tables representing our various entities, we then make tables that represent the interactions between entities. 
For example, interactions between patients, providers, and medications might be stored in a table called medication_orders. This table will record this interaction between a patient, provider, and medication, including the ID numbers of the entities involved along with other data like the date of the interaction and other details. 
For example, medication_orders might include a field that holds the patient ID who is to receive the order, a field for the medication ID being ordered, a field for the provider ID who placed the order, the date and time of the medication order, and other important details.
Whether these tables of interactions have primary keys and their own identifiers depends, but they often will.  For example, our "medication\_order" table has a primary key called "med\_order\_id", which uniquely identifies this particular interaction with this patient, this provider, and this medication, on this day. 
I'm now going to invite your participation.  In chat, tell me what you think: is the pat\_id in this table a primary key?  Why or why not?  
[Respond appropriately here, e.g.: Yes, that's right, there is repetition...]
The same patient might get have more than one medication order, and we need to allow for the patient id to repeat, so the pat\_id is **not** a primary key in this table.  Now, in the patient table, where each patient appears once and only once, the pat\_id **will** be a primary key.  Again, I'm going to ask you to tell me in chat. Is med\_id a primary key?
[Respond appropriately, e.g.: Oh, we have some difference of opinion on this one!]
While in this case, in the rows we see, there's no duplication, the fact is that ibuprofen gets ordered many times a day, and so does klonopin, and prozac, and cipro, and any number of medications.  Medications need to be able to repeat in the medication order table, so med\_id won't be a primary key in this table.  Now, back in the medication table, where each medication is listed once and only once, med\_id **will** in fact be a primary key.
Similarly, if we consider a provider, Dr. Smith, she'll be prescribing multiple medications in any given day during her work as a hospitalist. The provider id needs to repeat, so it's also not a primary keys. Instead, these IDs are references to other tables, and they are called foreign keys.  Foreign here means "originating in a different place than here."  The pat\_id is a foreign key in the medication\_order table, and it originated in the patient table.  The med\_id is a foreign key in the medication\_order table, and it originated in the medications table.

## Entity Relationships

<div style="width: 30%; float:left; padding: 1em;">

We can depict the relationships between tables, and indicate primary and foreign keys, using an **entity relationship diagram**:

</div>

<div style="width: 70%; float:left;">

@mermaid(erDiagram
    provider ||--o{ medication_order : orders
    provider {
        int provider_id PK

    patient ||--o{ medication_order :  receives
    patient {
        int pat_id PK

    }
    medication ||--o{ medication_order : prescribed
    medication {

    medication_order {
        int med_ord_id PK
        int pat_id FK
        int med_id FK
        int provider_id FK
        string order_date
        string notes
    })

</div>

--{{0}}--
We can depict the relationships between tables, and indicate primary and foreign keys, using an entity relationship diagram.  If this kind of diagram helps you, great!  If this is more confusing than it is helpful, you can just ignore this slide.  
What we see here is the depiction of four tables.  At the top you see patient, medication, and provider.  Each of these entities is linked to, or has a relationship with, the table called medication\_order, which is an interaction between these three entities.  
You can see that the pat\_id is a primary key in the patient table, but appears as well as a reference in the medication\_order table, where it's a foreign key.  Similarly, the med\_id and provider\_id are primary keys in their originating tables, and they are foreign keys in the table that uses them as references.  

## Why Bother With Normalization?

--{{0}}--
All of this may seem very complicated, so I want to go back to another example to show why organizing data in a normalized way is helpful. Consider the following example of a typographical error in a database.  When they set up the point of sale system at the supermarket, someone misspelled ‚Äúorange juice‚Äù, and now we want to correct that error.  On this slide, we have a single table representation of orders at a supermarket. This is the non-normalized way of organizing the data, trying to get everything on a single row. That‚Äôs why we have 50 columns, only a few of which are shown, to allow for many items in any given order.  In this non-normalized database table, consider what you would have to do here to fix the misspelling of orange juice.  How many places might the misspelled phrase appear?  Which columns could the typo exist in?  How many rows might the typo appear in?

**`orders`**

<div style="width: 50%; float:left;">

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style = "font-size: 0.7em; color = darkblue"-->
| order_num   | item_1   | item_2  | ...  | item_50  |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 23125    | orane juice  | pistachios     | ...    | `NULL`    |
| 41320    | peanut butter    | plain bagels     | ...    | orane juice    |
| 53011    | napkins    | distilled water     | ...    | `NULL`    |
| 14123    | pistachios    | orane juice     | ...    | peanut butter    |

</div>

<div style="width: 50%; float:left; padding:0em 2em;">

Here's a single table representation of orders at a supermarket.  Consider what you would have to do here to fix the misspelling of "orange juice."

</div>

## Why Bother With Normalization?

--{{0}}--
And here we have an alternate way of organizing the data. This is a normalized approach. We have an items table, which is an entity table, and it lists all the different items for sale at our supermarket.  Then we have an interaction table that shows the interaction between orders and items.
Consider what you would have to do in this normalized data organization style to fix the spelling of orange juice. 
Is it easier to correct the misspelling with the data stored in one single table or with the data in two tables in a normalized fashion?
[Respond appropriately to anything in chat]
Well, in the one-table option, we have to look for the typo anywhere in 50 columns across every single row ‚Ä¶ and keep in mind, there could be thousands of orders here!
In the two table option, we only have to find the misspelling once.  We will look in a single column, the column called item_ name.
And there we know that that item will occur only once: notice again in this display we have the PK indicating that item ID is a primary key which means that this item ID will not repeat. 
I‚Äôd like to pause here to look at chat and see if there are any questions so far.
To sum up where we are at this point, the theory of how to organize data for speed and efficiency is complex. However, it‚Äôs enough for now to understand that data in relational databases are fragmented into various tables using a process, called normalization.
Normalization helps reduce needless repetition, it simplifies data, and it improves system speed and performance.


<div style="width: 25%; float:left;">

**`items`**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style = "font-size: 0.7em"-->
| item_id (PK)  | item_name  |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| 15 | distilled water |
| 178 | napkins |
| 210 | orane juice |
| 97 | peanut butter |
| 108 | pistachios  |
| 233 | plain bagels  |

</div>

<div style="width: 25%; float:left;">

**`order_items`**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table"  style = "font-size: 0.7em"-->
| order_id | item_id |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| 23125 | 210 |

| 53011 | 15 |
| 14123 | 108 |
| 14123 | 210 |
| 14123 | 97 |

</div>

<div style="width: 50%; float:left; padding:0em 2em;">

Here's a different representation of the orders.  Here we have an `items` table that lists all the different items for sale.  And then we have a table that shows the interaction between orders and items.  Consider what you would have to do **here** to fix the misspelling of "orange juice."

## Quiz: Normalization

Why is data normalized (carefully fragmented to reduce repetition and inefficiency) in relational databases?  Select all the correct answers.

[[ ]] Relational database systems have a limit on number of columns permitted in a table, and must break up data in order to keep tables smaller.
[[X]] Because data is often one-to-many, storing data in a single table is inefficient.
[[X]] Normalizing data makes correcting or changing data simpler and less prone to error.
[[ ]] Normalization is a holdover from when most databases were business-related, but it is not necessary in biomedical research.
[[?]] There are multiple correct answers!
*********

<div class = "answer">

The reason for normalization isn't that relational database software lacks the capacity for very wide tables with lots of columns.  Rather, the kind of rich data that is stored in relational databases simply isn't right for storage in a single table.  

There are many one-to-many relationships in data, and this means that using multiple tables, one for each kind of concept (like "address" or "order" or "encounter") makes sense.  There is also a lot of repetition in data.  For example, multiple patients might live at the same address, and multiple patients are prescribed the same medication.  Multiple orders each contain the same popular product.  

This repetition means that it's much harder to correct or change data if we try to put as much data as possible into a single table. However, when a normalized model is used, and data is fragmented into concepts, things get easier.  Instead of correcting a product name thousands of times, once for each order that product appears on, we only have to correct it once, in the "product" table.

The reason for normalization is **not** that relational database software lacks the capacity for very wide tables with lots of columns. Rather, the kind of rich data that is stored in relational databases simply isn‚Äôt right for storage in a single table. There are many one-to-many relationships in data, and this means that using multiple tables, one for each kind of concept like address, or order, or encounter, makes sense.  After all, there‚Äôs a lot of repetition in data. For example multiple patients might live at the same address, and multiple patients are prescribed the same medication. These complex one-to-many relationships mean that it‚Äôs much harder to correct or change data if we try to put as much data as possible into a single table. 
However, when a normalized model is used, and data is fragmented into concepts, things actually get easier.  Instead of correcting a product name thousands of times, once for each order that that product appears in, we only have to correct it once in the product table.


## Key Vocabulary <span class="fa-solid fa-key"></span>

Fields that appear in two or more tables within a database are also sometimes called **join keys**, because they can be used to join data from the two tables into one set of interrelated data.  

Two categories of join keys are **primary keys** (unique within a table) and **foreign keys** (not unique, but come from -- and can be traced back to -- tables in which they **are** a primary key).


<div class = "cool-fact">
<b style="color: rgb(var(--color-highlight));">Did you know?</b><br>
The phrases "primary key" and "foreign key" originated in SQL, and if you use SQL, you need to learn them.  However, the concepts are useful in other situations and you might hear these terms used (less strictly and precisely) outside of relational databases.  "Let's use the student ID as the primary key," might be suggested, for example, even when the data is stored in .csv files, not in a SQL database.

OK, let's add a bit more vocabulary here by adding the term "join keys".  I don't often simply read slides aloud, but that's what we'll do here.

<div style="width: 50%; float:left;">

Which of the fields in this table is likely to be a primary key?  Select all that apply.

[[X]] procedure\_id
[[ ]] patient\_id
[[ ]] date
[[ ]] provider\_id
*********

<div class = "answer">

Because this table is about procedures, and there's an identifier that looks like it uniquely identifies each of these interactions, we can guess that "procedure\_id" is probably a primary key.  On the other hand, we know for sure that "date" and "provider\_id" can't be primary keys, because they have repeating values.  That makes sense -- the same provider can conduct many different procedure, and on any given **date**, there are likely to be many procedures.  By that same logic, we also know that "patient\_id" can't be a primary key... it needs to be possible for a patient to have more than one procedure!

OK, so here's another quiz question.  I'll bring up the poll in Teams, and when you're ready, let me know what you think the correct answer or answers are.

## Quiz: Keys

<div style="width: 50%; float:left;">

Consider the same fictional snippet of data from a table:

**procedure**

<!-- data-type="none" class="tight-table" style="font-size:0.8em;" -->
| procedure\_id   | patient\_id   | date  | provider\_id  |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 3411904326   | 834014     | 2020-01-30    | 56024     |
| 3411904329   | 320092     | 2020-01-30    | 56024     |
| 3411904330   | 612311     | 2020-01-31    | 99123     |

</div>
<div style="width: 50%; float:left;">

Which of the fields in this table is likely to be a foreign key?  Select all that apply.

[[ ]] procedure\_id
[[X]] patient\_id
[[ ]] date
[[X]] provider\_id
*********

<div class = "answer">

A foreign key is an identifier that originates in another table.  It certainly seems likely that there is a "patient" table and a "provider" table that the "patient\_id" and "provider\_id", respectively, originated in.  These are the two foreign keys.  The "procedure\_id" seems to originate here, in the "procedure" table, so it's not a foreign key, and the "date" just seems like, well, a date, not an identifier at all!

OK, so here's a second quiz question about the same data.  I'll bring up the poll in Teams, and when you're ready, let me know what you think the correct answer or answers are.
[Respond appropriately, e.g. "great job"]
The correct answers here are patient\_id and provider\_id.  A foreign key is an identifier that originates in another table.

## Review

**Normalization** breaks up data into tables that represent **entities** and tables that represent **interactions** between entities.  Data is organized in a way such that the number of columns is predictable and data repetition is avoided (well, except for IDs themselves, which end up getting repeated a lot!)

**Entities** are logical concepts like "patient" or "medication", each of which has specific aspects that adhere closely to that entity, like patient date of birth or medication class.

A **primary key** is an identifier that contains a unique value for each row in your table.  For example, the "item\_id" is a primary key for the "items" table in our supermarket example.  There will be no repeats of the "item\_id" in the "items" table.

A **foreign key** is an identifier in a table that makes reference to an identifier that originated in some other table and is a primary key there.  For example, in our "order\_items" table earlier, we had a column called "item\_id", which contained numbers that corresponded to the "item\_id" column in the "items" table. 

Together, **primary keys** and **foreign keys** are called **join keys**.

An **entity relationship diagram** is an illustration of how different tables in a relational database are related.  These diagrams often include details about join keys (primary and foreign keys).

Again, I'm just going to read this slide aloud as a review.
